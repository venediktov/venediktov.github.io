Need to create mapping from Win resonse into internal data cache for lookups , 
to find corresponding BidResponse to be able to finish transaction in the banker.

URL Key = {BidResponse.seatbid.bid.impid , BidRequest.id }

but internal key can be BidResponse structure in memory  indexed on  
BidResponse.seatbid.bid.impid , BidRequest.id

Banker-transaction-service with DB or persisted-cache:

Key = { BidResponse.seatbid.bid.impid , BidRequest.id, timestamp}

search-index1 = {BidResponse.seatbid.bid.impid , BidRequest.id}
search-index2 = {timestamp} >= comparator

Key => {account}

- account gets updated on notification by Banker-transaction-service 
   a.) complete  withdrawal, subtract amount from pending bucket
   b.) add transaction to audit table.
   
- account gets updated on expiration of timer ( testing timestamp field)
  a.) completing transaction by funds rollback operation that were put on hold in pending bucket 
  b.) add transaction to audit table

Main question :
- how many win notification will DSP receive say every 2-5 minutes , 100, 1000, 10000 ?
- what number of bids are sending upstream ( back to exchange ) ?
